Computer Lab's documentation for CBCS Undergraduate Physics Major
==================================================================
Hope this documentation will help the students at large and initiate some interest among those who are associated with this part of the syllabus. As it can be seen, with Python and Jupyter Notebook problems can be handled in a very meticulous way and final visualization of graphs is also fantastic.

I shall be happy to hear from you any sort of suggestions which will improve the documentaion. This documentation is still in the preparation stage. So, bibilographic part is missing and it will be included very soon.
